            <ScrollText text="The text gradient scroll component is designed to enhance user interaction by providing a visually dynamic effect as the user scrolls through the text. Unlike static text, this effect offers a more engaging visual experience with smooth color transitions that change as the text is scrolled. The animated gradient shifts add a modern and interactive touch to the user experience. This example was created using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion." />
